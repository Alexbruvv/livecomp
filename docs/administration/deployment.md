# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Livecomp is a reasonably standard client-server application, and can be deployment as such.
Due to the use of WebSockets, it does not currently support serverless deployment, and does not support horizontal scaling of the serverâ€”the latter will be addressed in the future.

This guide provides a simple method for deploying Livecomp on Linux, but assumes basic system administration knowledge.

## Manual deployment guide

Prerequisites:

- A Linux operating system (this guide was tested on Ubuntu)
- A PostgreSQL server with a database created for Livecomp
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

Firstly, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexbruvv/livecomp.git
cd livecomp
bun install
```

Then, configure the server.

```bash
cd apps/server
cp .example.env .env
nano .env # Update the configuration values to your own
```

To start the server, run the following command from the `apps/server` directory.

```bash
bun run src/server.ts start --port 3000 --migrate
```

This will start the server on port `3000` and run any necessary database migrations.
It is recommended that the `--migrate` flag is always passed.

Next, configure the client.

```bash
cd apps/client
cp .example.env
nano .env # Update the configuration values to your own
```

To start the client, run the following command from the `apps/client` directory.

```bash
bunx serve -s -l 3001
```

This will start the client on port `3001`. The `-s` flag ensures that all subpaths are routed to `index.html`.

Finally, from the `apps/server` directory, the following command can be executed to create a user.

```bash
bun run src/server.ts create-sysadmin-user <username> <password>
```

## Additional steps

This documentation specifies the basic steps to deploy the system, but administrators may wish to consider the following:

- Using a reverse proxy to route traffic to the client and server with TLS
- Using `systemd` services, or similar, to ensure the system remains up
- Writing a simple deployment script to deploy updates

Example deployment script (relies on [just](https://github.com/casey/just)):

```bash
cd livecomp
git pull

bun install

just build
just migrate

# Adjust to your own deployment
systemctl restart livecomp-server
systemctl restart livecomp-client
```
